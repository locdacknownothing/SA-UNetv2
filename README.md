## 🚀 Highlights
SA-UNetv2 improves upon the original SA-UNet by addressing class imbalance and multi-scale feature fusion gaps. It is designed for clinical deployment in resource-constrained, CPU-only environments.

- **Ultra-Lightweight**: Only **0.26M** parameters and **1.2MB** model size (50% smaller than SA-UNet).
- **Efficient**: Sub-second inference (**0.95s**) on a standard CPU.
- **State-of-the-Art**: Achieves top-tier performance on DRIVE and STARE datasets.

## 🛠️ Key Innovations
1. **Cross-scale Spatial Attention (CSA)**: Integrated into all skip connections to bridge the semantic gap between encoder and decoder features for the first time.
2. **Optimized Convolutional Blocks**: Redesigned with **Group Normalization (GN)** and **SiLU** activation for enhanced stability and gradient flow during training.
3. **BCE + MCC Compound Loss**: Combines pixel-level accuracy (BCE) with global correlation (MCC) to effectively handle extreme foreground-background imbalance.
